		<h2>Patient Education</h2>
		<p>	
			All pregnancies are at risk of preeclampsia. Yet some healthcare providers may overlook symptoms that suggest preeclampsia because they are also hallmarks of a normal pregnancy, or their patients may not report symptoms for fear of over-reacting. Something as simple as a headache could be a symptom of underlying and life-threatening preeclampsia.

			Our research shows that fewer than one-half of well-educated women are informed of the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and yet, in many settings, the expectant mother or somebody close to her could be the first responder to any symptoms. These findings do not bode well for women with lower literacy or who do not receive regular prenatal care. The Preeclampsia Foundation urges health care providers to ensure they and their patients properly understand the signs of preeclampsia.  Only through adequate knowledge and diligent follow through, can we move women to care earlier and thus alleviate the worst of the adverse outcomes.

  		The Preeclampsia Foundation (www.preeclampsia.org) presents this informative DVD to help physicians, nurses and allied health care professionals understand the biologic background and clinical implications of HELLP syndrome, a particularly dangerous, though less common, variant of preeclampsia. Dr. Judith Hibbard and two HELLP syndrome survivors – Johanna Aiken and Jill Siegel – join forces to provide a thorough explanation of HELLP syndrome. Dr. Hibbard, a board-certified Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist, provides a cogent scientific and medical description, interspersed with real life case studies provided by the women who survived their harrowing experiences with HELLP syndrome. This 48-minute video provides 1.0 Continuing Education Credit Hours with completion of enclosed registration and evaluation forms (additional fees apply). Price includes shipping and handling.
